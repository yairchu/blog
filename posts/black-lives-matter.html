    <p>The televised murder of the innocent George Floyd by police officers
has initiated a discussion about police brutality in the US,
specifically towards persons of color, along with a broader discussion
on racism and on empathy.</p>
<h2 id="racism-is-common">Racism is common</h2>
<p>Racism, ultranationalism, and brutal violence were widespread
throughout history and are still prevalent to this very day. It's not
just a small group of weirdos that are on the side of racism, it is
often the majority.</p>
<p>In the US, there's Trump. Certainly not all of his voters are racist,
but racism isn't a show-stopper for them, which makes them complicitly
racist.</p>
<h2 id="pick-your-battles">Pick your battles</h2>
<p>We can't address every injustice. That would devolve into
whataboutism and dilute the conversation. There certainly are horrible
things in the world. As a brief whatabout, what about prisoners in China
<a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/china-forcefully-harvests-organs-detainees-tribunal-concludes-n1018646">being
murdered for their organs</a>? Yes, that is horrifying, as are many
other things, but even so, we should try to stay on topic, because:</p>
<p>We don't have the time or capacity to know about everything, nor
ability to help. When an event triggers widespread attention on a
specific topic, like the Me-Too movement recently or Black Lives Matter
now, we do get the rare opportunity to make a difference, together!</p>
<p>If you care, then you should avoid whatabouting or retorting with
"All Lives Matter!". "Black Lives Matter" doesn't mean that other lives
don't. The context for this discussion is that US police act as if black
lives, specifically black, <strong>don't</strong> matter to them. In
this context, the retort communicates unwillingless to denounce these
actions of police, which implies a belief that black lives don't
matter.</p>
<h2 id="black-lives-matter">Black Lives Matter</h2>
<p>I said it in the title of this post, but I'd like to finish with a
simple message: Black Lives Matter, and police should be held
accountable for their actions. Police officers who murder should be
punished. It may sound obvious but sadly the reality is far from
this.</p>
<h2 id="defensive-appendix---on-being-a-phony">Defensive appendix - on
being a phony</h2>
<p>In this extra section I'd like to pre-emptively reply to an
anticipated comment. This hypothetical comment calls me a phony, for two
reasons -</p>
<p>I'm not American, what do I even know about American police? I do
feel embedded in american culture via the internet, TV, music.. But
also, everyone should feel welcome to the conversation. I also see the
discussion as part of a broader global discussion on empathy.</p>
<p>I'm also an Israeli, who spent four years of his life serving in the
Israeli military. This is the very same military that "temporarily", for
more than 40 years, maintains an Apartheid-like policy in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_C_(West_Bank)">"Area C"</a>. In
addition I can't help but notice that the BLM discussion is mostly
ignored in Israeli society. From all of my Israeli friends and
colleagues on Facebook, I've only noticed a single brave soul addressing
it. All I can say is that this reality made writing this post
challenging for me, and that I do agree that Israeli society has
<strong>a lot</strong> of soul-searching to do.</p>
<h2 id="misc">Misc</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Not all of Trump's voters are racist, but racism isn't a
show-stopper for them" - a very accurate observation from an unknown (to
me) source - I did read it somewhere but can't locate it at the moment.
If you know who observed this point it to me and I'll give proper
credit</li>
