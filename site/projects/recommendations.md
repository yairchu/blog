A small unordered list of movies which I highly recommended:

* [The Cider House Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cider_House_Rules_(film)), 1999: A coming-of-age drama based on a novel
* [Fried Green Tomatoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fried_Green_Tomatoes), 1991: A slightly comedic coming-of-age drama based on a novel
* [Kick-Ass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick-Ass_(film)), 2010: A comedy superhero film based on a comic book
* [A Perfect World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Perfect_World), 1993: A crime drama
* [Where the Crawdads Sing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_the_Crawdads_Sing_(film)), 2022: A coming-of-age drama based on a novel

These are all films that connected with me, and I may have even cried at some point while watching each of them. It looks like all of them tell small underdog stories.
