Over the years I've had my fair share of GUI development, using Qt, GTK, JUCE, FLTK, Kivy, GLFW, and web technologies.

By far the most difficult and frustrating of the bunch, with the worst documentation and most confusing APIs, was the web, where people legit struggle just to [center elements](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19461521/how-to-center-an-element-horizontally-and-vertically).

But time and time again I see people genuinely excited [to](https://forum.juce.com/t/introducing-blueprint-build-native-juce-interfaces-with-react-js/34174/2) use [web](https://ultralig.ht/) technologies [for](https://www.electronjs.org/) Desktop UIs.

My best guess for why people are excited is that for folks which have started their UI programming journey in the web, and had to overcome this struggle, assume that it's as difficult in other platforms, and are relunctant to needlessly go through the process of learning a new platform again. They are relieved by the promise of using web technologies on the Desktop, but I am horrified.
